# MinecraftServer

This is a personal server made by me, TooMatcha

To play this MODDED JAVA server, you'll need a few things:
(NOTE: Without these things, you WILL NOT be able to connect)

- CurseForge
- The Kingdom of Daldar Modpack

You will need to launch Minecraft through the CurseForge launcher under the 'Kingdom of Daldar' modpack. (It may look fuzzy while loading in, it's okay!) From here, it will ask you to login with your usual Minecraft credentials, and then the game will load in yadda yadda.

And then from the main menu, you’ll navigate to Multiplayer, Add Server, and then you can name the server whatever you’d like to remember it as, BUT in the Server Address portion, you will need to type in either of these:

TooMatcha.mcpro.io

OR

51.222.108.13:41539

Assuming you downloaded everything correctly, you should see a green checkmark next to the listed server that was named whatever you decided to name it. From there, just click in and you should be loaded into my modded server!

There will be rules and guidelines written at the spawnpoint of the server, and the difficulty is hard, but you keep your items after death as the mobs are VICIOUS!

:heart: EXTRA: Installing Optional Shaders
Now to make the most of the beauty of this modpack, I HIGHLY recommend shaders. 

I use Optifine combined with Sildur’s Shaders, but you could use any optimization mod partnered with any shaderpack you’d like. The only prerequisite is that the optimization mod you choose MUST BE 1.16.5 as the modpack runs on a 1.16.5 instance of Minecraft!

Here is where you can find what I use:
- Optifine (You MUST download the 1.16.5 version. Click "Show All Versions" and scroll down to the 1.16.5 one to download. DO NOT RUN THIS JAR FILE AFTER DOWNLOADING)
- Sildur's Shaders (For this shaderpack, I recommend just downloading the latest version, as all versions will work with any instance of optifine. This shaderpack has options ranging from Lite to Extreme, so even a toaster could run this pack)

I tried to be as detailed as possible in the steps, so they may look a bit long and daunting. If you already know how to install shaders, just do what you'd normally do BUT in the files of the modded instance of minecraft. Otherwise, see my lengthy explanation below. It is meant to be understood by shader beginners.

HERE ARE THE STEPS:

- In the CurseForge launcher where you hit 'Play' to run the modded version of Minecraft, right-click "The Kingdom of Daldar" instead of hitting 'Play' and then click on 'Open Folder'

- Locate the mods folder in the window that just popped up and open it. (This window contains all the features of this modpack)

- Now on your computer, open your folder (typically Downloads) containing the 1.16.5 version of Optifine (or whatever op mod you chose) and drag that JAR file into the mods folder that should also be open.

- Now in the mods folder, step back into the parent folder by using the back arrow button in top-left corner. You should now be back in the main folder of the mods, which was what you saw when you first clicked 'Open Folder'.

- Create a folder here called shaderpacks (no spaces, no capitalization, no special characters). This is usually as easy as clicking somewhere in the folder (make sure nothing is accidentally selected) and clicking New, and then New Folder and renaming it to shaderpacks.

- Now find where you downloaded the shaderpack (in my case, Sildur's Shaders) and drag that ZIP file into the newly created shaderpacks folder.

- Restart Minecraft (from the CurseForge launcher ALWAYS) and then if you go into Options and then Video Settings, you should now see a button titled 'Shaders'. Click on that, select the shaderpack you downloaded (it should appear as listed) and then your Minecraft should load it in.

- And voila! Hop into my server or a singleplayer game and you should now see your shaders working!
